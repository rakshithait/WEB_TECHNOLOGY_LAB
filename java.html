<h2><a id="intro">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>
JAVA was developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems Inc in the year 1991, later acquired by Oracle Corporation. It is a simple programming language. 
Java makes writing, compiling, and debugging programming easy. It helps to create reusable code and modular programs.
</p>
<p>
The principles for creating java were simple, robust, secured, high performance, portable, multi-threaded, interpreted, dynamic, etc. 
James Gosling in 1995 developed Java, who is known as the Father of Java. Currently, Java is used in mobile devices, internet programming, games, e-business, etc.

<h2><a id="function">Functions</a></h2>
<p>
Method is a block of code which only runs when it is called.
You can pass data, known as parameters, into a method.
Methods are used to perform certain actions, and they are also known as functions.
Why use methods? To reuse code: define the code once, and use it many times
</p>
<p>
A method must be declared within a class. It is defined with the name of the method, followed by parentheses ().
 Java provides some pre-defined methods, such as System.out.println(), but you can also create your own methods to perform certain actions.
</p>
<h2><a id="array">Arrays</a></h2>
<p>
Java array is an object which contains elements of a similar data type. Additionally, The elements of an array are stored in a contiguous memory location.
 It is a data structure where we store similar elements. We can store only a fixed set of elements in a Java array.
</p>
<p>
C array is beneficial if you have to store similar elements. 
For example, if we want to store the marks of a student in 6 subjects, then we don't need to define different variables for the marks in the different subject. 
Instead of that, we can define an array which can store the marks in each subject at the contiguous memory locations.
</p>
<p>
In Java, array is an object of a dynamically generated class. Java array inherits the Object class, and implements the Serializable as well as Cloneable interfaces. 
We can store primitive values or objects in an array in Java. Like C/C++, we can also create single dimentional or multidimentional arrays in Java.
</p>
<h2><a id ="pointer">Pointers</a></h2>
<p>
Pointers in Java are easy and fun to learn. Some C programming tasks are performed more easily with pointers, and other tasks, such as dynamic memory allocation, cannot be performed without using pointers.
 So it becomes necessary to learn pointers to become a perfect C programmer. 
</p>
<p>
A pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable, i.e., direct address of the memory location. Like any variable or constant, you must declare a pointer before using it to store any variable address. The general form of a pointer variable declaration is −

type *var-name;
</p>

<h3>String</h3>
<p>
Strings are defined as an array of characters. The difference between a character array and a string is the string is terminated with a special character ‘\0’.
