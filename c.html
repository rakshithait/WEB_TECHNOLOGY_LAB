<h2><a id="intro">C Introduction</a></h2>
<p>
C is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It can be used to develop software like operating systems, databases, compilers, and so on. C programming is an excellent language to learn to program for beginners.
Our C tutorials will guide you to learn C programming one step at a time.

<h2><a id="function">C Functions</a></h2>
<p>
A function is a block of code that performs a specific task.Suppose, you need to create a program to create a circle and color it. You can create two functions to solve this problem:
create a circle function
create a color function
Dividing a complex problem into smaller chunks makes our program easy to understand and reuse.
</p>
<h2><a id="array">C Arrays</a></h2>
<p>
An array is defined as the collection of similar type of data items stored at contiguous memory locations.
 Arrays are the derived data type in C programming language which can store the primitive type of data such as int, char, double, float, etc. 
 It also has the capability to store the collection of derived data types, such as pointers, structure, etc. 
 The array is the simplest data structure where each data element can be randomly accessed by using its index number.
</p>
<p>
C array is beneficial if you have to store similar elements. 
For example, if we want to store the marks of a student in 6 subjects, then we don't need to define different variables for the marks in the different subject. 
Instead of that, we can define an array which can store the marks in each subject at the contiguous memory locations.
</p>
<h2><a id ="pointer">C Pointers</a></h2>
<p>
Pointers in C are easy and fun to learn. Some C programming tasks are performed more easily with pointers, and other tasks, such as dynamic memory allocation, cannot be performed without using pointers.
 So it becomes necessary to learn pointers to become a perfect C programmer. 
</p>
<p>
A pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another variable, i.e., direct address of the memory location. Like any variable or constant, you must declare a pointer before using it to store any variable address. The general form of a pointer variable declaration is −

type *var-name;
</p>

<h3>String</h3>
<p>
Strings are defined as an array of characters. The difference between a character array and a string is the string is terminated with a special character ‘\0’.
